People have access to a seemingly endless supply of news, but their news feed could use some improvement. On one end, news feeds fail to deliver relevant, interesting articles suited to its audience. On the other end, news feeds attempting to deliver news suited to its audience frequently over-personalize, leaving the audience with a narrow range of topics, repeated information, and biased outlooks. What&rsquo;s more, most people do not recognize the shortcomings of their news feed. People fail to realize more interesting news is out there for them, or that their news is biased because the news feed does not inform them of this debacle. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c18">The basis of our project is to create a web service for delivering curated news, selected personally for each individual user. Two methods are used to establish a personal &lsquo;taste&rsquo;, as it were, for each user. To establish baseline interests, one will be able to subscribe a variety of topics and news outlets. As time goes on, each user&rsquo;s interests can be further refined based on periodic feedback and a user&rsquo;s viewing history. Where we differ from other news curation applications is in the means by which we select news. Currently, web search is often limited to content matching - if you search &ldquo;Minnesota Vikings&rdquo;, you may only be able to see articles containing those words. Various machine learning algorithms and web-search techniques will allow us to not only perform content matching, but also perform searches based on news topics and interconnectedness between articles, such as matching &ldquo;Minnesota Vikings&rdquo; with &ldquo;Mike Zimmer&rdquo;, the head coach of the team.</span><span class="c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">In addition to this, existing platforms with personalization features fail to allow a user to &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; the taste developed for their profile. As it currently stands, if I, for example, look at news about a Supreme Court appointment one day, there&rsquo;s no way to tell the program that it was a one-time occurence, and I, in fact, am not as interested in politics as the algorithm may think I am. We plan on implementing a mechanism with which which users can manually override the taste determined by the algorithm, and get more news that they actually want.</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c16">These methods of personalization, search techniques, and the ability to &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; - all built upon a fast and reliable web application- make our proposed news curation service superior to any other service available today.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c6">1.2 &nbsp;Project Objectives</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c6"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c18">The first business objective for this project is to create a proof of concept, with which we can then gather feedback from focus groups and potential users. </span><span class="c3">Our project is the first step in a continuous cycle of prototyping, gathering feedback, and making improvements to our product</span><span class="c18">.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">In addition to this, another objective is to implement a feature pertaining to &ldquo;unlearning&rdquo; the topics associated with a user&rsquo;s taste.

This doesn&rsquo;t allow the user to easily expand their horizons and explore other options that might interest them. It also doesn&rsquo;t allow the user to give feedback on the content it provides. Our product would determine the user&rsquo;s potential interests based on their clicks, set preferences, and feedback and provide news from sources the user might not be familiar with. It will also solely focus on news so that its scope doesn&rsquo;t spread too thin. </span></p><hr class="c25"><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c31">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c10">https://www.blog.google/products/news/new-google-news-ai-meets-human-intelligence/</span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c5 c21"></span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c31">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.amazon.com/docs/flashbriefing/understand-the-flash-briefing-skill-api.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1538461140120000">https://developer.amazon.com/docs/flashbriefing/understand-the-flash-briefing-skill-api.html</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c31">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c10">https://www.blog.google/products/news/new-google-news-ai-meets-human-intelligence/</span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c5 c21"></span></p></div><div><p class="c8"><a href="#ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt4">[4]</a><span class="c31">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.amazon.com/docs/flashbriefing/understand-the-flash-briefing-skill-api.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1538461140121000">https://developer.amazon.com/docs/flashbriefing/understand-the-flash-briefing-skill-api.html</a></span></p></div><div class="c19"><p class="c22"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c5 c14">Provide general context, then scope in on news.</span></p></div><div class="c19"><p class="c22"><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a><span class="c5 c14">Added this.
